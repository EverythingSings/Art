"content": "18th January 2024\nI really liked this book called 'Reality Hunger' by David Shields. It made me think about what is real and what is not. The book has a lot of quotes from other people, but their names are not next to the quotes. Instead, the names are in the back of the book.\nHere are some of the quotes I liked:\n- 'Rothko is great because he made other artists think differently about painting.' This helped me understand what makes an artist great.\n- In a world where there are many free copies of things, having a lot of copies isn't what makes you rich. Now it's more about relationships, connections, and sharing.\n- The author seems to think that everything is interesting.\n- The author likes when life is unexpected and mysterious, and he thinks this is best shown when a book can be many different things, like a story, a fantasy, a memoir, or a report.\nThe author doesn't say he owns the ideas in the book. It's like he thinks all ideas come from everywhere and nowhere.\nLeaving things out is a way of creating something new.\nThose were quotes from the book. The rest of this review is my own thoughts, or at least I think they are. It's hard to know for sure.\nPeople are arguing a lot about who owns ideas, especially with things like AI that can create art. I think these arguments will be difficult to solve. AI is making it easier for people to make beautiful art, and some artists don't like that. It reminds me of when the camera was invented.\nArt is about feelings, and if some people feel angry about AI art, that's okay.\nI liked that this book felt relaxed and lively, kind of like Zen.\nIf you like art, I think you should read this book. I really enjoyed it and I think I will read it again in the future."
