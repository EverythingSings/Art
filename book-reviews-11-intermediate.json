Not his ideas, but his pronunciation. This didn't detract from the experience very much, but it's something to consider if you want to read this book.\nI thought this was a good exploration of our new AI world. I liked seeing the perspective of someone who is close to academia and business. It was consistently interesting, even if the concepts weren't entirely new to me. I don't know if I learned a lot of unique ideas, but he did cover lots of ground. This is a book I'd recommend to someone if they haven't thought a lot about AI and how our world will change. \nYou can tell he made an effort to make it as accurate as possible, as an academic does, and that's a hard task with something so new as AI. Near the end he did start projecting into the future, trying to predict different possible outcomes, and I appreciated this. I think this portion could have been more thought out. Not that he made errors necessarily, but it wasn't as exhaustive as I would have liked. This book reminded me that I am interested in far-future predictions. I want to continue studying Futurology, and will probably look for something more advanced."
