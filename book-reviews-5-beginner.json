  "content": "17th Feb 2023\nhttps://hackingwithswift.com \nI'm a big fan of Paul's work, and this book demonstrates his commitment to creating quality content once again. Paul says 'great code is thoughtful code', and then goes on to show us what makes code thoughtful with plentiful examples ranging from MVC, MVVM, SwiftUI architecture, and even into more detailed concepts like associative storage and key paths. \nThis book focuses on Swift but also does a good job at including the more classic, language agnostic patterns all while providing helpful examples in Swift. I thought this was incredibly interesting and I recommend it to anyone who isn't a complete beginner to Swift. "
