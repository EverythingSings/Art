  "content": "2023 Book of the Year\nWe're all creatives in some fashion. How conscious are we of our creative process? How can we discover more about our creativity? What stops us from creating to the best of our potential?\nI've listened to this book multiple times through this year and it's incredibly rewarding each time. Not only does each chapter offer incredible, direct insight, but you can feel the wisdom behind each beautiful sentence.\nThese lessons are carried into my everyday living, my programming and my conversations, and not just my artistic passions. For this reason I highly recommend it to everyone, not only those who identify as artists. Thank you."
