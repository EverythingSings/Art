  "content": "11th Mar 2023\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35827220-dogs-of-war\n'Dogs of War' by Adrian Tchaikovsky is a thought-provoking and emotionally resonant novel that explores the ethical implications of bioengineering and artificial intelligence. The story follows a pack of augmented animals, led by the dog Rex, a bloodthirsty monster that just follows orders. \nThroughout the story, Tchaikovsky's prose is vivid and evocative, bringing the reader into the minds of the characters and immersing them in the world of the novel. The author expertly weaves together themes of identity, freedom, and loyalty, asking difficult questions about what it means to be sentient and autonomous. As usual these characters are entirely unique and intriguing. Some of the bioengineering took me by surprise, introducing me to concepts I hadn't explored before. \nOverall, 'Dogs of War' is a powerful and thought-provoking novel that will keep readers thinking long after they finish the book. Tchaikovsky's writing is captivating and immersive, and his exploration of the intersection of technology and ethics is both timely and deeply resonant. This is a must-read for fans of science fiction and anyone interested in exploring the boundaries of what it means to be alive.\nNote to Reader:\nLife happened and I lost my commitment to writing book reviews. I was still reading, but not as intentionally as I was before. I read 'There Is No Antimemetics Division' by qntm and I loved it a lot. This was sometime around July of 2023. I don't feel confident in writing a proper review for it, since so much time has passed, but I do recommend it. \nFor 2024 I want to recommit to writing reviews. I don't know if I will have the same output as before, because I am indeed reading less than I was, but it's still a form of art I want to pursue. I appreciate you dearly. "
